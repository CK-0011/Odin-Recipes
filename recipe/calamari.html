<h3>Tasty crispy fried Calamari</h3>
<p>Fresh catch of the day</p>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup whole milk (or low fat buttermilk)</li>
    <li>1 lb uncooked, cleaned, calamari cut into circles (and tentacles if available)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
</ul>


<ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <h3>Clean Squid:</h3>
    <li> Remove the head from the mantle (body) by gently pulling on the head and tangles to pull out the innards. Make
        sure to remove the beak from underneath the tentacles by gently squeezing it and pulling it out. Cut off the
        tentacles right between the eye and where they connect.</li>
    <li>Pull the cartilage out of the mangle and rinse out the tentacles and the mantle inside and out. Take the skin
        off, if you wish, by pinching it and pulling it off. It should peel off quite easy.</li>
    <h3>Soak:</h3>
    <li>Place sliced squid into a small mixing bowl and add whole milk until it's just covered. Add a couple of pinches
        of salt and mix well.</li>
    <h3>Before Frying:</h3>
    <li>Add oil into a deep, cooking pan, a 2.5-3 qt pot, or a skillet and let it heat up to 365째-375째 over medium-high
        heat. (You can also use a fryer if you have one.)</li>
    <li>Cover a wire rack with a couple of paper towels and place it inside a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
    <li>In a wide, shallow bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <h3> Frying Calamari:</h3>
    <li>When oil comes to temperature, it's time to fry.</li>
    <li>Pull squid pieces out of milk and let excess milk drip off back into the mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Set aside and let it soak while you prepare to fry. (Give it about 15-20 minutes to soak.)</li>
    <li>Toss the squid into the flour mixture and gently toss the pieces around to coat them evenly but make sure they
        are not clumping. It's best to do it in batches to the pieces are coated evenly and don't clump together.</li>
    <li>Carefully add dredged calamari into the hot oil using either metal slotted spoon or metal tongs. Let it cook for
        2-3 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Take calamari out of the oil using a metal slotted spoon, metal slotted spatula or metal tongs. Spread cooked
        calamari onto the prepared paper towel covered wire rack. Repeat with remaining calamari.</li>
    <h3>NOTE: If you are working in small batches, you can keep fried calamari warm by placing the prepared wire rack
        into the oven heated to 150째170째.</h3>
    <h3>Serve fried calamari with marinara sauce or lemon aioli**.</h3>
