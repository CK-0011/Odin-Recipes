<h3> Scrumptious multi-layered chocolate cake</h3>
<p>Our famous cake that is an absolute must try...</p>
<ul>
    <h3>FOR THE CAKE LAYERS</h3>
    <li>300g golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>150g light brown sugar</li>
    <li>300g plain flour, sifted</li>
    <li>100g fine dark cocoa powder, sifted</li>
    <li>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
    <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
    <li>5 medium eggs</li>
    <li>250ml buttermilk</li>
    <li>200ml vegetable </li>oil, plus extra to grease</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract</li>

    <h3>FOR THE FROSTING</h3>
    <li>200g dark chocolate (about 72% cocoa solids)</li>
    <li>500g icing sugar</li>
    <li>50g fine dark cocoa powder</li>
    <li>300g soft salted butter</li>
    <li>½ tsp sea salt flakes</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract</li>
    <li>6 tbsp hazelnut or almond liqueur (or use milk if you prefer)</li>
    <li>chocolate shavings to decorate (see ‘Kitchen tip’), optional</li>
</ul>


<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C, fan 160C, gas 4. Grease and line three 18cm diameter cake tins. </li>
    <li>Mix all the dry ingredients for the cake together. Beat the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla bean paste
        together in a jug or bowl. </li>
    <li>Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Beat well until you have a smooth
        batter then divide between the prepared cake tins. </li>
    <li>Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a cake skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tins for 10
        minutes, then remove to a wire rack and leave to cool completely.</li>
    <li>For the frosting, break the chocolate into small pieces and place in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently
        simmering water,
    <li>making sure the water doesn’t touch the base of the bowl. Heat until the chocolate has melted, then remove from
        the heat and leave to cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Sift together the icing sugar and cocoa powder to remove any lumps. Beat the butter in a large bowl until creamy
        then add half of the icing sugar and cocoa powder mixture. </li>
    <li>Beat until combined, then add the rest of the mixture and continue to beat. Slowly mix in the cooled chocolate
        along with the salt, vanilla and liqueur or milk until smooth.</li>
    <li>Level the top of the cakes if necessary and slice each in half horizontally. </li>
    <li>Place one cake layer on a stand or plate and cover with a layer of frosting. </li>
    <li>Stack the cakes with frosting between each layer and then cover the top and sides with the remaining frosting,
        swirling with a palette knife. </li>
    <li>Decorate with chocolate shavings, if using. Leftovers keep for up to 3-4 days in an airtight container.</li>
