<h3> Amazing onion chicken casserole recipe</h3>
<p>This dish comes straight from Nona's kitchen out of the rural parts of Italy</p>
<ul>
    <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut horizontally if they’re too thick)</li>
    <li>1 or 2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Red crushed chili pepper flakes, optional</li>
    <li>Pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (or Gruyere)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>5 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>Fresh chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
</ul>


<ol>
    <li>To make the French onion chicken casserole: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease a 9×12-inch
        baking dish and set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook for
        5-8 minutes until soft.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are caramelized – about 15 minutes. Pour
        in 1/4 cup of broth to deglaze
        if your pan gets too dry, and keep stirring until onions are browned.</li>
    <li>Stir in fresh minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat and allow to cool
        slightly.</li>
    <li>Season chicken breasts with oregano, crushed chili pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Go easy on
        the salt because
        French onion and cheese are already salted. Arrange chicken breasts in the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Divide caramelized onions on top of each chicken breast. Sprinkle shredded cheese on top and bake for 20-25
        minutes in the
        oven (or more, depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts), until fully cooked and cheese is bubbly.
        Then broil for 2
        minutes to crisp up the cheese. Garnish the French onion chicken casserole with fresh chopped parsley and serve
        immediately with steamed vegetables or cauliflower rice. Enjoy!</li>
